# Pose Detection and Annotation using MediaPipe and Machine Learning
This project demonstrates the process of detecting facial landmarks using MediaPipe, predicting pose angles (pitch, yaw, and roll) using machine learning models, and annotating a video with axes representing the detected pose orientation.
